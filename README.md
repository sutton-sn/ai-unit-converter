# Celsius to Fahrenheit Converter using TensorFlow

This repository contains a TensorFlow model that converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit using a neural network. The model is trained using a simple dataset and demonstrates the process of creating, training, and using a neural network in TensorFlow.

## Training Process

The model was trained for 10,000 epochs using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function.
